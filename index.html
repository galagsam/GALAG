                Samuel Dela Fuente Galag
              </h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                am Samuel dela fuente galag, born on August 20 in the city of Las piñas City to noemi galag and Joel galag. We are 6 siblings and I'm the youngest.
                When I was very young, I was a shy child. I rarely talk to other people. Examples of this are visitors, relatives and others. Usually I am always in the room when there are guests in our house and when I am in another house I am always next to or behind my parents or siblings. But over time I got rid of my shyness because my relatives told me that it is better to look at a person if he is not shy. So since the day I was given advice, I have gradually learned to socialize with other people.
                I also had many passions when I was young. But playing basketball is what gave me the true meaning of enjoyment in sports or passions in life. I also like to do housework which serves as my skill in my old age.
                I spent my elementary school years at sta. Magdalena elementary school and my secondary school at  sta.magdalena National High School
                When I started my studies, many trials came to me. This is where I started thinking about things that can be a solution to them. This is one of the instruments that helped me grow into a good and resourceful person. The experience I went through and became in secondary school (high school) is one of the most important of all, because it was the people I experienced the true meaning of happiness where I met some of the real people that I have become. I was with you in sadness and happiness when we were still studying and these are also some people who have been my support until now. And it was during this time that I learned the importance of education. It was difficult for me to graduate from high school probably because of the various trials I went through. But, in spite of all this I managed and completed my secondary school.
                The tests I went through didn't end at the same time I graduated from secondary school. The next chapter was even more difficult because my parents couldn't handle me going to college anymore. But because of my determination to study, I chose to take a vocational course so that somehow I have something to hold on to when I face the real challenge of life-this is to find a permanent job for my future and for my family. By the grace of God, I completed two years of study in the course

              What is Plagiarism?
            </h5>
          <p>Plagiarism is the act of taking someone else’s work, ideas, or intellectual property and using it without proper acknowledgment, thereby presenting it as if it were your own original creation. This unethical practice can take many forms, including copying text verbatim, paraphrasing without giving credit, or even reusing your own previously submitted work without permission (self-plagiarism). Plagiarism undermines the principles of honesty and integrity, which are fundamental in academics, creative industries, and professional environments. It not only disrespects the original creator's efforts but can also lead to significant consequences, such as loss of credibility, legal repercussions, and damage to reputation.</p>

                <h5>
              Consequences of Plagiarism?
            </h5>
            <p>The consequences of plagiarism can be serious and far-reaching, affecting both academic and professional reputations. In educational settings, students may face penalties such as failing grades, suspension, or even expulsion. In professional environments, plagiarism can lead to job loss, damaged credibility, and legal repercussions if copyrighted material is involved. Additionally, it undermines trust, damages relationships, and tarnishes an individual’s integrity. Beyond personal consequences, plagiarism devalues the work of original creators and erodes the overall quality of scholarly and creative endeavors.</p>

            <h5>
              How to Avoid Plagiarism?
            </h5>
            <p>To avoid plagiarism, always give proper credit to the original sources of any ideas, words, or data you use in your work. Use quotation marks for direct quotes and include citations following the appropriate style guide (e.g., APA, MLA, or Chicago). When paraphrasing, ensure the rephrased text is significantly different from the original while still crediting the source. Keep careful notes of all references during research to track where ideas come from. Utilize plagiarism-checking tools to ensure originality and avoid unintentional copying. Finally, understand and follow ethical standards in your field to maintain academic and professional integrity.</p>

        <p>Virus
          <p>
            <p>A virus is a type of malicious software (malware) designed to replicate itself and spread from one device to another. It typically attaches itself to legitimate programs or files and activates when the host file is opened or executed. Viruses can corrupt files, steal data, or disrupt system operations.</p>
        <p>Malware</p>
        <p>Malware is a broad term encompassing any software intentionally designed to harm, exploit, or otherwise compromise computers, networks, or devices. It includes various types like viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, and adware. Malware can steal sensitive information, lock users out of their systems, or degrade system performance.</p>
        <p>Antivirus</p>
        <p>An antivirus is a program designed to detect, prevent, and remove malware, including viruses, from computers and other devices. Antivirus software scans files and programs for known malicious code patterns and uses heuristic analysis to identify suspicious behavior. Modern antivirus programs also provide real-time protection and updates to guard against emerging threats.</p>
